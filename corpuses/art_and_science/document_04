Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art.
Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art.
On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art.
Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.
However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression.
The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions.
The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.
